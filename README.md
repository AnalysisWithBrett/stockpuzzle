# Using Machine Learning to Predict Football Outcomes

#### -- Project Status: Almost Done

## Project Intro/Objective
Best Cart Mini Marts have convenience retails stores in most gas stations in Great Britain. They sell a vast range of products at their stores. By nature, all their retail stores are relatively compact, and therefore, are limited in terms of how much stock they can carry. Additionally, overstocking and waste increase greenhouse gas emissions because more goods are produced, transported, and disposed of than necessary. This increases the carbon footprint of the store. Therefore, identifying the right stocking mix throughout the year is a key driver of success for Best Cart Mini Marts.

I have provided with sales data from 2022 to enable me to provide data-driven recommendations on the right stocking mix throughout the year ahead. There are products that sell consistently at the same volume throughout the year, and some go through significant fluctuation over the year. Therefore, it is key that I keep practical considerations in mind while doing my analysis; considerations such as product positioning (premium or budget), seasonality, alliances with specific brands to name just a few examples. 

Another suggestion from the Best Cart team was to look very closely at data for quality issues. He mentioned some common data entry errors included spelling mistakes, missing fields, same products being listed as different products due to inconsistent naming, and incorrect categorisation of products. He also mentioned that recently, a system misconfiguration resulted in the country code being updated as “UK” instead of the designated “GB”.

### Methods Used
* Data Cleaning and Manipulation
* Data Visualization
* Data Transformation with Box-Cox and Logarithm
* Linear Regression

### Technologies
* R 
* Microsoft Power BI

## Project Objective
* Optimizing Stocking Mix: Analyze sales data from 2022 to identify products that sell consistently and those that experience significant fluctuations throughout the year. Consider practical factors such as product positioning (premium or budget), seasonality, and brand alliances to determine the optimal stocking mix.

* Data-driven Recommendations: This project is data-driven, utilizing sales data from 2022 to make informed recommendations for the year ahead. We will identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data to guide stocking decisions.

* Quality Control: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data is crucial for effective analysis. Common data entry errors such as spelling mistakes, missing fields, inconsistent naming, and incorrect categorization of products can skew the analysis. Measures will be implemented to address these issues, such as data validation and system configuration checks.

* Correcting System Errors: Recent system misconfigurations, such as the incorrect country code being updated as "UK" instead of "GB," need to be addressed to ensure accurate data analysis and reporting.

### Methodology
1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
* Data Sources: Gather sales data from 2022 and any other relevant datasets that may aid in the analysis, such as temperature, rainfall, and even covid-19 cases.

* Data Cleaning: Perform thorough data cleaning to address common issues such as missing values, duplicates, spelling mistakes, inconsistent naming, and incorrect categorization of products. Ensure data integrity and consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Trend Analysis: Identify trends and patterns in sales data to understand overall sales performance and seasonal variations.

* Product Analysis: Analyze individual product performance, including sales volume, revenue, and profitability. Identify products with consistent sales and those with significant fluctuations throughout the year.

* Segmentation: Segment products based on practical considerations such as product positioning (premium or budget), seasonality, and brand alliances.

3. Statistical Analysis:
* Correlation Analysis: Determine correlations between various factors such as product characteristics, seasonality, and sales performance to identify key drivers of sales.

* Forecasting: Use time series analysis or other forecasting techniques to predict future sales trends and anticipate demand fluctuations for different products.

4. Optimization:
* Stocking Mix Optimization: Utilize the insights gained from EDA and statistical analysis to optimize the stocking mix throughout the year. Prioritize products based on their performance, seasonality, and strategic importance.

5. Reporting and Recommendations:
* Documentation: Provide detailed documentation on data cleaning processes, analysis methodologies, and findings with Microsoft Power BI

* Recommendations: Generate data-driven recommendations for the optimal stocking mix throughout the year based on the analysis. Consider practical factors such as product positioning, seasonality, and brand alliances to support decision-making processes for Best Cart Mini Marts.
